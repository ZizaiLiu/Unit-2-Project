    <h1 class="tittle"> 24 Solar Terms</h1>

    <h2>During the <strong>Shang Dynasty</strong> (<em>17th century BC - 1046 BC</em>), ancient people have decided
      <strong>4 solar terms</strong>: The Spring Equinox (<em>Chun Fen</em>), The Summer Solstice (<em>Xia Zhi</em>),
      The Autumn Equinox (<em>Qiu Fen</em>), The Winter Solstice (<em>Dong Zhi</em>) by observing the shadow at noon.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the shadow is shortest in a year, it is Summer Solstice, the longest is Winter Solstice and the moderate is
      Spring Equinox or Autumn Equinox. In Zhou Dynasty (<em>11th century BC - 221BC</em>), eight solar terms were used.
      In 104 BC, the astronomical positions of 24 solar terms were decided

        phenomena. Generally, each lunar month contains two solar terms, and each solar term in Chinese culture has many
        poems describing it and some to-do customs. </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Spring</strong>: starting from Beginning of Spring, until Beginning of Summer, including the first,

    <h2>The History Of The 24 Solar Terms</h1>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 1 below!-->
      <p>These twenty-four solar terms each suggest the position of the sun every time it travels15 degrees on the
        ecliptic longitude. A cycle is that earth revolves around the sun for one time. It begins from the Beginning of
        Spring (<em>Li Chun</em>) and ends at Greater Cold (<em>Da Han</em>). In each month there are often two solar
        terms; </p>

      <br>
      <p>the first one is generally named 'Jie Qi' and the other one 'Zhong Qi'. Their dates are mirrored by the
        Gregorian
        calendar, so we find that during the first half of a year 'Jie Qi' is around the 6th day of a solar month,
        'Zhong
        Qi' around the 21st; in the second half of a year, 'Jie Qi' is around the 8th and 'Zhong Qi' around the 23rd.
